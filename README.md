# Portfolio.Tracker Excercise 

## Some Notes

* 100% code coveage except for the UI component (I use JebBrain Rider for Code Coverage).

* MVP implementation. No logging, global exception handling, etc. 
* Testing framework use. XUnit, Moq, MockHttpHandler.
* Minimum UI implemntation. Sorry, been a while since I work with WinForms.
* Simple layered projects (similar to micro-services). 
* FileStream doesn't have native Async IO. Wrapped with Task.Run instead.
